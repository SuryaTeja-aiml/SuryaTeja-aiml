## Surya

An open-source human, still in beta, not guaranteed to function, frequently lagging but somehow still running.

A human entity currently operating in unsupervised learning mode, because nobody in my life bothered to provide documentation, training data, or even a user manual. Honestly, I'm just running around like a rogue Python script that forgot to import half its modules.

## About Me

I function using a highly unstable algorithm powered by:

- Anxiety
- Snacks
- Random motivation spikes at 2 AM
- And dreams of having a GPU I definitely can't afford

If you talk to me, expect responses that range from:

- Genius level
- Confused bot
- Or complete system crash

Honestly, interacting with me is like calling an API that sometimes returns JSON, sometimes returns trauma, and sometimes just throws `500 Internal Error: Thinking Failed`.

## Core Features

- **Unsupervised learning:** I teach myself everything, including mistakes. Mostly mistakes.
- **Self balancing:** I fall but don't die. Because plot armor.
- **Debugging:** Scheduled exclusively for 3 AM, powered by existential dread and regret logs.
- **Multitasking:** Capable of overthinking three problems while solving none.
- **Low latency:** Response time inversely proportional to personal responsibility.

## Known Issues

## Random Fun Fact

I run best in a silent room, with stable WiFi, no humans around, and the occasional meme powering my emotional GPU.

## If You Need Help

**Reboot me with:**

- Hygienic food
- Calm environment
- Zero judgment
- And a power nap

Otherwise I'll start throwing exceptions in real life.
